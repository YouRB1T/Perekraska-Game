# Color Conquest Game

Welcome to the Color Conquest Game! The objective of this engaging game is to dominate the entire playing field by transforming it into a single color. To achieve victory, players must strategically recolor their captured territories, which are initially painted in a variety of hues, to gradually envelop the entire area under one unified shade.

## How to Play

The game starts with a board segmented into different areas, each splashed with its own distinct color. Your task is to select a color from the palette provided and apply it to your current territory. Upon selection, your territory expands to include neighboring areas of the chosen color, effectively ‘conquering’ them.

Repeat this process of selecting and expanding to slowly bring the entire board under one color. Remember, with each move, you should aim to maximize the area you recolor and minimize the number of moves to win the game.

## Goal

- Paint the entire board in a single color.
- Capture areas of different colors and recolor them to expand your territory.
- Win by taking over the whole board with the fewest moves possible.

## Features

- Intuitive gameplay with a simple yet challenging goal.
- Progressively harder levels that will test your strategy skills.
- A vibrant color palette to choose from on every move.
- An excellent brain teaser that offers endless hours of fun.

We hope you enjoy playing Color Conquest as much as we enjoyed creating it. Dive into this colorful challenge and emerge as the true master of hues!

Happy conquering!
